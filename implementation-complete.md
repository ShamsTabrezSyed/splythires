The SplytHires Consultation Popup has been further redesigned and refined. The overall height of the popup has been reduced by approximately 15%, making it more compact while remaining perfectly centered. The vertical scrollbar has been removed from the Calendly section, ensuring the entire calendar fits naturally. Text color for relevant elements has been changed to solid black for better contrast and readability. Line spacing between text and bullet points has been reduced, and padding/margins have been adjusted to create a tighter layout. The blue gradient background for the left panel is confirmed to be from `#0052D4` to `#00BFFF`. The `styles-light.css` file has been updated to reflect these comprehensive changes.
